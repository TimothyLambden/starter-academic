Hey, It's Timothy! I'm an incoming NanoDTC student at Cambridge University who loves all things nanoscience. You'll find a few of my articles about my research and nanoscience on here, and anything intresting I stumble across and want to share. I also enjoy photography in my spare time and thought I'd keep everything in one place.
